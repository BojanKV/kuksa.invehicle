# FOTA Raspberry Pi

The fota scripts are used by the kuksa-appmanager to flash firmware images to the Raspberry Pi.
Details on the interaction with the appmanager can be found in [kuksa-appmanager/wiki/fota.md](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/blob/master/kuksa-appmanager/wiki/fota.md).

### kuksa-firmware-flash
When called, expects one line of JSON via stdin, containing the firmware name, version and files.
Currently only one file is supported which must be a firmware OS image.

### kuksa-firmware-get-version
Expects a firmware name as argument and prints a version to stdout.
Currently the only supported firmware name is *osimage* (name of the software module in hawkbit).
For this it returns the version the version of the currently installed OS according to /etc/os-release.

## Preliminaries
The SD card has to have three partitions:

1. boot partition
2. rootfs partition A
3. rootfs partition B

Only one rootfs partitions is active at a time.
When a new firmware is flashed, it is flashed to the inactive partition and the bootloader configuration is updated to switch to the other partition.

When the meta-kuksa-bsp layer is used, the AGL image for the Raspberry Pi will contain these three partitions, with partition A active and partition B inactive and empty.

## Firmware OS image
The firmware has to consist of exactly one file.
It must be an image containing a boot partition and a rootfs partition.
Two file types are supported:

* uncompressed .img file
* compressed .xz file (highly recommended)

The images generated by the yocto build process for AGL can be used directly.

## Rollback functionality
Is under development
